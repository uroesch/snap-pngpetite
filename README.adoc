https://github.com/uroesch/pngpetite[Pngpetite] is a script to reduce the 
size of PNG images significantly. The code is based on Crush by 
Christopher Simpkins and has been adapted to Linux by refactoring 
it. As the code base shows significant differences the name has also 
been changed.

NOTE: The snap is in beta state and may not work as intended. As such it is
  provided as is!
